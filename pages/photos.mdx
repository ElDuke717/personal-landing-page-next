# Photos

This is a collection of photos that I think are interesting.  Most of them are of wildlife or nature.  I've taken all of the photos myself, except for the one of me at 18 years old.

A spotted turtle [_Clemmys guttata_](https://www.fws.gov/species/spotted-turtle-clemmys-guttata) in our neighbor's yard.  This is a threatened species in the endemic to the eastern United States.
