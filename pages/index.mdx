I'm a Software Engineer with a focus on frontend and fullstack development. 

I use JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, and TypeScript for my work.  I also have experience
contributing to several open source projects including Reactime, a performance monitoring tool for React applications.

I enjoy crafting interactive, functional, accessible and aesthetically appealing websites and applications.  
 
My primary interests are walking, reading (philosophy, natural sciences, technology), writing and spending time with my family.
