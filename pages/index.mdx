# Hi, I'm Nick

I'm a Software Engineer with a focus full-stack frontend development. I've gained proficiency with JavaScript ES6+, React, HTML5, CSS, Node.js, and Express.js. I'm also skilled with  Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, and TypeScript.  My passion is crafting interactive, functional, and aesthetically appealing websites.  
 
I've also contributed to open-source projects during my career. A notable contribution was to Reactime, a popular Chrome extension for developers using React. This tool provides developers insightful state snapshot visualization and web metrics tracking, helping to increase productivity and improve code quality. 

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
