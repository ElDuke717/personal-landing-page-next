# Hi, I'm Nick

I'm a Software Engineer with a focus full-stack frontend development. I've gained proficiency with JavaScript ES6+, React, HTML5, CSS, Node.js, and Express.js. I'm also skilled with  Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, and TypeScript.  My passion is crafting interactive, functional, and aesthetically appealing websites.  
 
I've also contributed to open-source projects during my career. A notable contribution was to Reactime, a popular Chrome extension for developers using React. This tool provides developers insightful state snapshot visualization and web metrics tracking, helping to increase productivity and improve code quality.
